## Algorithms & data structures

Algorithms and data structures are fundamental to efficient code and good software design. This repository's goal is to demonstrate how to correctly implement common data structures and algorithms in the simplest and most elegant ways for competitive programming.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

This reposiotry provides algorithm implementaion in C++.

## Running an algorithm implementaion
To compile and run any of the algorithms here, you need to have a gcc compiler and a code editor.

Make sure to create two files for inserting and getting output
